{"body":"### Currently developed by Tommy Bergeron / 2012.\r\n\r\n#### Project status: **Ready for development** [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Brainpad/ThinAir.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tbergeron/ThinAir)\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### Update 2012-08-19\r\nTests are now working again, everything is back to normal. Welcome to ThinAir 0.3.x!\r\n\r\n##### Update 2012-08-16\r\nThinAir finally has a npm package! See installation instructions for more details. Tests aren't working since I'll have to tweak them to adapt to the new package structure. It shouldn't take long.\r\n\r\n##### Update 2012-07-28\r\nThinAir is now _Ready for development_. What it means is that developers who want to try the framework and develop project with it are now welcome to do so! Documentation is almost 100% finished, if anything seems missing, please open an issue. \r\n\r\n##### Update 2012-07-27\r\nDocs are finally done! Not deeply explanatory but still, every component of ThinAir has been covered. If any questions are left to be answered do not hesitate to open an issue!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nThe main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. \r\n\r\nThis ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.\r\n\r\nAnother goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even *PHP* developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.\r\n\r\nIf this is still unclear for you, go checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/Brainpad/ThinAir/wiki/FAQ).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: You can't install the package globally yet. (`npm install -g ...`)\r\n\r\n- First be sure to add `./node_modules/.bin` to your PATH\r\n- Create a new directory for your project\r\n- Use `npm install thinair` to install ThinAir to your current directory\r\n- Use `thinair init` to create the basic project structure\r\n- And finally use `thinair start` to start your new application! \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo start ThinAir, simply type:\r\n```\r\nthinair start\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can read more  about ThinAir usage in the [wiki](https://github.com/Brainpad/ThinAir/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\nTo update to the latest version you can simply use `npm update thinair`.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n - [Tommy Bergeron](https://github.com/tbergeron)\r\n - [Raynos](https://github.com/Raynos)\r\n - [Florian Margaine](https://github.com/Ralt)\r\n - [Hubert Perron](https://github.com/hubertperron)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThanks to [Raynos](https://github.com/Raynos) for his help, patience and many contributions.\r\n\r\nThanks to [Florian Margaine](https://github.com/Ralt) for all the time you've spent helping me finding great solutions!\r\n\r\nThanks to [Hubert Perron](https://github.com/hubertperron) for kicking my ass in the good direction when I'm trying too hard to reinvent the wheel! ;-)\r\n","tagline":"PITA-less Web Development Framework","note":"Don't delete this file!
