# ThinAir
## PITA-less Web Development Framework built with Node.js.
### Currently developed by Tommy Bergeron / 2012.

#### Project status: **Ready for development** [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Brainpad/ThinAir.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tbergeron/ThinAir)

***
##### Update 2012-08-16
ThinAir finally has a npm package! See installation instructions for more details. Tests aren't working since I'll have to tweak them to adapt to the new package structure. It shouldn't take long.

##### Update 2012-07-28
ThinAir is now _Ready for development_. What it means is that developers who want to try the framework and develop project with it are now welcome to do so! Documentation is almost 100% finished, if anything seems missing, please open an issue. 

##### Update 2012-07-27
Docs are finally done! Not deeply explanatory but still, every component of ThinAir has been covered. If any questions are left to be answered do not hesitate to open an issue!

## Goals

The main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. 

This ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.

Another goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even *PHP* developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.

If this is still unclear for you, go checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/Brainpad/ThinAir/wiki/FAQ).

## Installation

**NOTE**: You can't install the package globally yet. (`npm install -g ...`)

- First be sure to add `./node_modules/.bin` to your PATH
- Create a new directory for your project
- Use `npm install thinair` to install ThinAir to your current directory
- Use `thinair init` to create the basic project structure
- And finally use `thinair start` to start your new application! 

## Usage

To start ThinAir, simply type:
```
thinair start
```

You can read more  about ThinAir usage in the [wiki](https://github.com/Brainpad/ThinAir/wiki).

## Updates
To update to the latest version you can simply use `npm update thinair`.
