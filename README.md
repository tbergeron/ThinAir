ThinAir
=========
###### PITA-less Web Development Framework built with Node.js. Developed by Tommy Bergeron.
###### Project status: **Ready for development** [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tbergeron/ThinAir.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/tbergeron/ThinAir)

***

## Goals

The main goal of *ThinAir* is to give a basic but versatile set of tools to Node.js user and newcomers for building web applications. 

This ain't no revolution, but a simple, concised way of achieving what you want without having to re-invent the wheel.

Another goal I have in mind while doing this project is to show everyone (even *PHP* developers!) that Node.js projects are fun, flexible and can finally replace those old technologies once and for all.

If this is still unclear for you, go checkout the [FAQ](https://github.com/Brainpad/ThinAir/wiki/FAQ).

###### TL;DR: Simple MVC framework based on Node.js and MongoDB.
